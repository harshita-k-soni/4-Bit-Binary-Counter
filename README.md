# 4-Bit-Binary-Counter
Binary counter using Arduino Uno, push buttons and LEDs<br>
This project demonstrates how to create a 4-bit binary counter using an Arduino Uno. The counter increments with each press of a push button, and the binary count is displayed using LEDs.

# Hardware Setup:
Connect a push button to any digital pin on the Arduino Uno.<br>
Connect four LEDs to digital pins 2 to 5 on the Arduino Uno.
